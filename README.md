# Cali #
This project is a small calculator game prototype I started to make in my free time. Clic on the buttons to input numbers and equations, gains coins if the answer to your equation is the current requested number (shows in console), get rewarded for longer streaks. Input 777 to unlock the casino module. Cali might or might not interrupt you from time to time, breaking your streak and bringing you much joy qith meaningless dialog. I was working on a level system as well, not sure if that was finalized. This is still very much a work in progress.
